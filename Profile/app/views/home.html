                        <p>First, thank you for opening my project. I know, you maybe reviewing my project or you are the same as me learning technology. I appricate that I have a listener at this time. </p>
                        <p>As a large apart of programmer come from other countries, I am also a foreigner fly far away from China to study computer science in US. If you ask me why the choice, I would say I love new technologies that pushing the civilization. Some people may laugth:"Really?" I have to say, you are right. At the beginning, while choosing major in computer science, I just want to study these cool things. However, after a while, I began to feel boring and tough especially algorithms. I use to hate these stuff. There was a time I do worse in exams. Everyone feel sad about me. What's wrong with me? I ask myself. I couldn't get the answer as I feel dispointed with study. Fortunately, I got in touch with other new things outside the book, I begun to do some small projects by myself. Each time I finish a small project, watching the program running in my lovely screen, I feel happy. Then, I continute my life as an engineer. Guys, do not give up when you feel bad, life is a box of cholocate, you will never know what will happen next. Hope you find your happiness whole life.
                        </p>
